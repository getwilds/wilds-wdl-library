**Work in Progress**: This workflow is currently under active development. While functional, the modular components are still being organized for optimal reusability within the WILDS ecosystem. The current implementation provides a complete analysis pipeline but will be refactored into importable modules in future releases.

A WILDS WDL workflow for comprehensive genomic analysis using consensus variant calling from multiple algorithms on targeted panel sequencing data, with planned support for structural variant detection.

## Overview

This workflow performs end-to-end analysis of human panel/PCR-based sequencing data with a focus on leukemia analysis. It implements a consensus variant calling approach that combines results from three different variant callers (GATK HaplotypeCaller, GATK Mutect2, and samtools/bcftools) to provide high-confidence detection of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions/deletions (indels).

The workflow is designed for targeted sequencing panels commonly used in leukemia research and clinical diagnostics, providing comprehensive variant annotation and quality control metrics. **Planned enhancements include integration of structural variant (SV) callers** to detect larger genomic rearrangements, translocations, and copy number variations that are particularly relevant in leukemia analysis.

## Features

- **Multi-caller consensus approach**: Combines GATK HaplotypeCaller, Mutect2, and bcftools for robust SNV/indel detection
- **Planned structural variant detection**: Future integration of SV callers for translocations, CNVs, and large rearrangements
- **Comprehensive annotation**: Uses Annovar with customizable protocols for variant annotation
- **Quality control**: Includes bedtools coverage analysis and Picard hybrid selection metrics
- **Leukemia-focused**: Optimized for targeted panel sequencing in leukemia analysis with clinically relevant variant types
- **Base quality recalibration**: GATK BQSR for improved variant calling accuracy
- **Flexible reference support**: Compatible with hg19 and hg38 reference genomes

## Workflow Steps

1. **Read Alignment**: BWA-MEM alignment to reference genome
2. **Duplicate Marking**: Picard MarkDuplicates for PCR duplicate identification
3. **Base Quality Recalibration**: GATK BQSR using known variant sites
4. **Quality Control**: 
   - Bedtools coverage analysis over target regions
   - Picard hybrid selection metrics for enrichment assessment
5. **Variant Calling**: Three independent variant callers for SNVs/indels:
   - GATK HaplotypeCaller (germline variants)
   - GATK Mutect2 (somatic variants, tumor-only mode)
   - samtools/bcftools mpileup (general variant calling)
6. **Variant Annotation**: Annovar annotation with customizable protocols
7. **Consensus Analysis**: R-based consensus calling combining all three callers
8. **Planned: Structural Variant Detection**: Integration of SV callers for comprehensive genomic analysis

## Requirements

- WDL-compatible workflow executor (Cromwell, miniWDL, Sprocket, etc.)
- Docker/Apptainer support
- Target panel BED file defining regions of interest
- Reference genome files (FASTA, indices, known variant sites)
- Paired-end FASTQ files from targeted sequencing

## For Fred Hutch Users

Fred Hutch users can use [PROOF](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/dasldemos/proof-how-to/) to submit this workflow to the on-premise HPC cluster:

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Update `inputs.json` with your sample paths and reference files
3. Update `options.json` with your preferred output location
4. Submit through PROOF interface

**Important Notes:**
- All file paths must be accessible to the cluster (e.g., `/fh/fast/`, AWS S3)
- Reference files are available on the cluster at standard locations
- Enable call caching (`write_to_cache`, `read_from_cache`) to avoid re-processing

## Docker Containers

This workflow uses the following WILDS Docker containers:

- `getwilds/gatk:4.3.0.0` - GATK variant calling and processing
- `getwilds/bwa:0.7.17` - BWA alignment
- `getwilds/bedtools:2.31.1` - Coverage analysis
- `getwilds/bcftools:1.19` - Variant calling with samtools/bcftools
- `getwilds/annovar:{ref_name}` - Variant annotation (reference-specific)
- `getwilds/consensus:0.1.1` - Consensus variant calling in R

All containers are available on both DockerHub and GitHub Container Registry.

## Configuration Guidelines

### Reference Genome Setup

The workflow supports both hg19 and hg38. Ensure all reference files are from the same genome build:
- Use `ref_name: "hg19"` or `ref_name: "hg38"`
- All reference files must match the specified build
- Annovar container is automatically selected based on `ref_name`

### Annovar Configuration

Customize annotation protocols based on your analysis needs:
```json
{
  "annovar_protocols": "refGene,knownGene,cosmic70,gnomad211_exome,clinvar_20180603",
  "annovar_operation": "g,f,f,f,f"
}
```

Common protocols for leukemia analysis:
- `refGene`, `knownGene`: Gene-based annotation
- `cosmic70`: COSMIC cancer variants
- `gnomad211_exome`: Population frequencies
- `clinvar_20180603`: Clinical significance

## Development Status

**Current Status**: The workflow is functional and produces reliable results for leukemia panel analysis.

**Upcoming Changes**:
- Refactoring into modular components for the WILDS WDL Library
- **Integration of structural variant callers** for detection of translocations, copy number variations, and large genomic rearrangements
- Individual tasks will be separated into importable modules
- Enhanced testing and validation framework
- Additional quality control and visualization components

**Using This Workflow**: While the workflow is stable for analysis, expect structural changes as it transitions to a modular architecture. Pin to specific commits for reproducible analyses.
