# WILDS WDL Workflows

**Work in Progress** - This section is under active development and not yet complete.

WILDS WDL workflows are complete, publication-ready analysis pipelines that demonstrate the full power of the WILDS ecosystem. These workflows combine multiple modules and custom logic to perform comprehensive bioinformatics analyses suitable for research publications.

## Workflow Philosophy

The WILDS workflow system is designed around several key principles:

### **End-to-End Analysis**
Each workflow provides:
- Complete analysis pipelines from raw data to publication-ready results
- Integration of multiple bioinformatics tools and modules
- Quality control and validation at each step
- Comprehensive output generation and reporting

### **Production Ready**
Workflows are designed for:
- Real research applications with large datasets
- Robust error handling and recovery
- Scalable resource allocation
- Reproducible results across different environments

### **Modular Foundation**
While comprehensive, workflows:
- Import tasks primarily from WILDS modules where possible
- May include custom tasks for specialized analysis needs
- Follow WILDS standards for documentation and testing
- Maintain compatibility with the broader WILDS ecosystem

## Workflow Structure

Each workflow directory will contain the following standard components:

```
workflows/workflow-name/
├── workflow-name.wdl       # Main workflow file
├── inputs.json             # Example inputs for testing
├── options.json            # Execution configuration
└── README.md               # Workflow-specific documentation
```

### **Planned Components**

- **WDL File**: Complete analysis workflow importing modules and custom tasks
- **Input Examples**: Realistic input configurations for different use cases
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive usage guides and parameter explanations
- **Test Data**: Sample datasets for validation and demonstration

## Development Status

The workflows tier is currently in development. We are:
- Converting existing WILDS workflows to the modular architecture
- Designing comprehensive testing strategies for complex pipelines
- Establishing standards for workflow documentation and validation
- Building example workflows that demonstrate best practices

## Contributing

While workflows are still in development, we welcome:
- Suggestions for high-priority workflow types
- Feedback on the proposed workflow structure
- Contributions to workflow testing and validation approaches
