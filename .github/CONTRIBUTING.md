## Getting Started

Before contributing code changes, please:

1. **[Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo)** to your GitHub account

2. **Set up your development environment** with the required tools:
   - For local testing:
       - [miniWDL](https://miniwdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#install-miniwdl)
       - [sprocket](https://sprocket.bio/installation.html)
       - [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for automated local testing
   - [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) for container execution

3. **Make code changes** and push them to your fork

4. **Submit a pull request (PR)** to merge your contributions into the `main` branch of the original repo
    *   The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.
    *   If your contribution resolves an issue, the body of your PR should contain `Fixes #issue-number`

## Repository Structure

The WILDS WDL Library follows a three-tier architecture:

- **Modules**: Collection of tasks that use a given tool
- **Vignettes**: Small example pipelines that import module tasks
- **Workflows**: Production-ready pipelines

```

## Types of Contributions

### 1. Bug Reports and Issues

- Use the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/getwilds/wilds-wdl-library/issues) page
- Provide detailed information about the problem
- Include error messages, info about input files, and steps to reproduce
- Tag issues appropriately (bug, enhancement, question, etc.)

### 2. Documentation Improvements

- Fix typos, improve clarity, or add missing information
- Enhance README files with better examples

### 3. Module Contributions

- Focus on one high-utility bioinformatics tool
- Follow standardized module structure
- Include comprehensive testing and validation

### 4. Vignette Contributions

- Combine 2-3 existing modules
- Demonstrate common analysis patterns
- Provide educational value for the community

### 5. Workflow Contributions

- Create publication-ready analysis pipelines
- Integrate multiple modules
- Include comprehensive validation with realistic datasets

## Module Development Guidelines

**See our [ww-template module](https://github.com/getwilds/wilds-wdl-library/tree/main/modules/ww-template) as an example**

**The module folder must contain:**

1. **`ww-toolname.wdl`** - Main WDL workflow file named for the tool it uses
2. **`README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation


**Your WDL file must include:**

- **Version declaration**: Use WDL version 1.0
- **Example workflow**: A `toolname_example` workflow that uses all tasks for testing
- **Task definitions**: Individual tasks with proper resource requirements
- **Proper imports**: Use GitHub URLs for dependencies on existing WILDS WDL modules (e.g. for downloading test data)
- **Metadata documentation**: Describe properties of the workflow and tasks (e.g. inputs, outputs)

**Parameter preferences:**

- Use descriptive parameter names
- Include optional parameters with sensible defaults
- Support both single samples and batch processing where applicable

**Docker image preferences:**

- Use images from the [WILDS Docker Library](https://github.com/getwilds/wilds-docker-library) when available
- If creating new images, follow WILDS container standards and consider contributing to the [WILDS Docker Library](https://github.com/getwilds/wilds-docker-library).
- Specify exact image versions (avoid `latest` tags)
- Document image dependencies in the README


## Vignette Development Guidelines

**Vignettes should:**

- Combine 2-3 existing modules from the library
- Demonstrate realistic analysis workflows
- Serve as educational templates
- Use publicly available test data

**No New Tasks Rule**

- Vignettes should **only** combine existing modules - do not create new task definitions. If you need new functionality, contribute it as a module first.

**Vignette inputs.json**

In order to pass the automated GitHub Action (GHA) tests, your `inputs.json` must:

- Use no more than 4 CPUs (for the sprocket executor)
- Use input files that get downloaded as part of the GHA.
    - See the `download-test-data` job within `./github/workflows/vignettes-testrun.yml`
    - Modify `vignettes-testrun.yml` as needed

## Workflow Development Guidelines

**Workflows represent the highest tier and must meet production standards:**

- **Comprehensive validation**: Extensive testing with realistic datasets
- **Scalability**: Support for large datasets and batch processing
- **Documentation**: Thorough documentation to aid in publication

## Testing Requirements

### Local Tests

Make sure you have these installed:

- [miniWDL](https://miniwdl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#install-miniwdl)
- [sprocket](https://sprocket.bio/installation.html)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started/) for container execution

Test your WDL locally before submitting a PR:

```bash
cd modules/ww-toolname

# Linting with miniwdl
miniwdl check ww-toolname.wdl

# Linting with sprocket (ignoring things we don't care about)
sprocket lint \
  -e TodoComment \
  -e ContainerUri \
  -e TrailingComma \
  -e CommentWhitespace \
  -e UnusedInput \
  ww-toolname.wdl

# Test running
miniwdl run ww-toolname.wdl
sprocket run ww-toolname.wdl
```

For automated local testing be sure to have [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) installed also and use our Makefile.

### Test Data

- Use the [`ww-testdata` module](https://github.com/getwilds/wilds-wdl-library/tree/main/modules/ww-testdata) for standardized test datasets
- If you need additional test datasets, modify the `ww-testdata` module also
- Include small, representative test files in your examples

### Automated Tests

All contributions must pass our automated testing pipeline which executes on a PR via GitHub Actions:

- **Multi-executor validation**: Tests with Cromwell, miniWDL, and Sprocket
- **Container verification**: All Docker images must be accessible and functional
- **Syntax validation**: WDL syntax and structure validation
- **Integration testing**: Cross-module compatibility testing

## Pull Request Process

After meeting the requirements above, submit a PR to merge your forked repo into `main`.

1. **Create descriptive PR title**:
   - Examples: `Add BWA alignment module`, `RNA-seq analysis example vingette`

2. **Fill out PR template**: Provide detailed information about your contribution

3. **Link related issues**: Reference any GitHub issues your PR addresses

4. **Request reviews**: Tag Emma Bishop (@emjbishop) or Taylor Firman (@tefirman)

### Review Criteria

Your PR will be evaluated on:

- **Functionality**: Does it work as intended?
- **Testing**: Are tests comprehensive and passing?
- **Documentation**: Is documentation clear and complete?
- **Standards compliance**: Does it follow WILDS conventions?
- **Code quality**: Is the WDL code well-structured and readable?
- **Uniqueness**: Does it avoid duplicating existing functionality in the library?

## Help for new contributors

New contributors are welcome! If you're new to WDL or bioinformatics workflows:

- Review our [WDL 101 course materials](https://github.com/getwilds/wdl-101)
- Check out existing modules for examples
- Don't hesitate to ask questions in issues or via email. If you have a `uw.edu` or `fredhutch.org` email you can also ask questions in our `fh-data` [slack workspace]([https://hutchdatascience.org/joinslack/)
- Consider starting with documentation contributions
